i18n
====

Rdsys uses the module [go-i18n](https://github.com/nicksnyder/go-i18n) for
internationalisation of its user-facing interfaces.  This document discusses
how one requests new translations (e.g. when we add new strings or modify
existing ones) and fetches finished translations (i.e. when volunteers finished
their translations).

Request new translations
------------------------

When we modify existing or add new strings, we must *extract* these strings, so
they can make their way to weblate, where our volunteers take care of
translations.

Run the following command in rdsys's root directory to extract strings:

    make translations

This command writes translation files to the pkg/locales/ directory. weblate
will fetch those files automatically from the repository in gitlab and provide 
it for translators.

Fetch finished translations
---------------------------

Once we pushed new strings to weblate, our volunteers start translating them.
The updated translations are publised in the translations repo on the rdsys
branch:
  https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/translation

Before compiling a new version of the distributors we manually copy all the
finished translations into pkg/locales. The status of the translations can be
seeing in the weblate website:
