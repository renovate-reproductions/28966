Gettor distributor and updater
===============================

The gettor distributor provides links to download Tor Browser
from uncensored providers over email. It is used by users on networks where 
the main Tor download website is being blocked, so they can send an email to 
gettor and receive a response with a link to download Tor Browser that will 
not be blocked in their network.

It is implemented as a resource in the backend, a distributor that
communicates over email and an updater that uploads the new Tor Browser 
releases to the providers.

TBLink resource
---------------

TBLink resources are defined in rdsys backend and contain the following
metadata:

* Tor Browser download link
* signature download link
* language (en, pt-BR, ...)
* platform (linux64, win32, osx64, ...)
* version

They are different than most other resources in rdsys as they are stored in 
disk by rdsys, not partitioned and updated by an updater process.

While most other resources are passively pulled by rdsys kraken service TBLink 
resources are updated by an external process (the gettor updater) that sends 
the updates to the backend over HTTP requests. They are stored as a json file 
on disk.

TBLink resources are unpartitioned, so each distributor with access to them 
gets the full list of resources. There is no need in gettor to assign resources 
to unique distributors.

Tor Browser releases might be for some platforms and not others. The backend, 
distributors. and updater are designed to provide the latest version for 
each platform.

Gettor updater
--------------

The gettor updater monitors Tor Browser releases, and when there is a new 
release uploads it to all the supported providers (github for now) and 
sends the new links to the backend over http to be propagated to the 
distributors.

It does listen to the [release 
json](https://aus1.torproject.org/torbrowser/update_3/release/downloads.json) 
and get the latest version for each platform of the Tor Browser and its 
signature to upload to each provider.

Gettor distributor
------------------

The gettor distributor listens to incoming emails over IMAP and responds with 
links to download Tor Browser for the requested platform and language. 
It does accept the platform and/or language being provided in the subject or 
the body of the email.

If platform is provided the distributor will answer with a help email 
describing how to use the service. If the platform is provided but no language 
is provided it will send the download links for the requested platform and 
*en-US* language.

There are three predefined platform aliases:
* **windows**. That will provide *win32* bundles.
* **linux**. That will provide *linux64* bundles.
* **osx**. That will provide *osx64* bundles.

Providers
---------

* **github**. Uses a single repo with a release per platform, where the files 
  are release assets.
* **gitlab**. Uses one repo per platform, the files are included in the repo.
  The current version is in the project description.
* **gdrive**. Google drive.
* **s3**. Used for internet archive. Uses a bucket per platform and version.
