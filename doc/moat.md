Moat distributor
================

The moat distributor is an API that clients use to get bridges and circumvention 
settings. Clients use Domain Fronting to avoid censorship when connecting to the 
API.

There are two different mechanisms to discover bridges in moat:

* Captcha based. Implemented in BridgeDB, provides bridges and uses captchas to 
  protect from attackers. Has being the main mechanism in Tor Browser to 
  discover bridges until Circumvention Settings were added.
* Circumvention Settings. Uses the client location to recommend a pluggable 
  transport to use.

Each mechanism is seen from the rdsys backend as a different distributor (`moat` 
and `settings`) and has a different pool of bridges assigned to it.

[[_TOC_]]


Circumvention Settings protections
----------------------------------

The resources provided `/circumvention/settings` and `/circumvention/defaults` 
use a combination of two mechanisms to make it harder for attackers to list all 
the bridges.

Resources are grouped so each resource will only be distributed in a certain 
time period (`rotation_period_hours`), and will not be distributed again until a 
number of periods has passed (`num_periods`). If `rotation_period_hours=24` and 
`num_periods=30`, resources will be divided in 30 groups, and each group will be 
distributed during one day. A single resource will not be distributed again 
until 30 days has passed.

The IP address of the requester will be used so over the same rotation period 
every IP coming from the same subnet will get the same resources on each 
request.

API
---

The moat API is located in https://bridges.torproject.org/moat/ and reachable 
over domain fronting. All endpoints described here are located under the moat 
url, for example */fetch* full url will be 
https://bridges.torproject.org/moat/fetch.

They will always get a *HTTP Status 200* response with a json object, whether or 
not the request was valid or had produced an error.

### Error responses

If an error is produced the response json will contain a list of errors with the 
following form:
```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "code": 400,
      "detail": "Not valid request"
    }
  ]
}
```

Where the *code* field contains a numeric code representing the error and 
*detail* a human readable description of the problem.

### Circumvention Settings endpoints

The Circumvention Settings endpoints are used to gather information on different 
circumvention mechanisms and what work on each country.

Most requests to the Circumvention Settings endpoints are to use the HTTP POST 
method with an optional json payload. Some requests that don't take arguments 
can be used as GET requests, for example /circumvention/builtin and 
/circumvention/countries.

#### /circumvention/settings

Uses the location of the requester to give a list of circumvention mechanism 
that works on the location and specific information on how to configure them. If 
the country code is not provided in the request body, it will discover the 
requester location from its IP address.

##### request

An optional request body can be provided with the following fields:
* `country` indicates the country where the client is located. Used when the 
  user inputs the country manually instead of using the geolocation service.
* `transports` a list of supported transports by the client. Only supported 
  transports will be returned in the settings response.

The fields are optional, and can be provided individually or as a combination in 
the same payload.

```json
{
  "country": "de",
  "transports": ["obfs4", "snowflake"]
}
```

##### response

The response will be a json with the following structure:

```json
{
  "settings": [
    {
      "bridges": {
        "type": "obfs4",
        "source": "builtin",
        "bridge_strings": [
          "obfs4 209.148.46.65:443 74FAD13168806246602538555B5521A0383A1875 cert=ssH+9rP8dG2NLDN2XuFw63hIO/9MNNinLmxQDpVa+7kTOa9/m+tGWT1SmSYpQ9uTBGa6Hw iat-mode=0",
          "obfs4 38.229.33.83:80 0BAC39417268B96B9F514E7F63FA6FBA1A788955 cert=VwEFpk9F/UN9JED7XpG1XOjm/O8ZCXK80oPecgWnNDZDv5pdkhq1OpbAH0wNqOT6H6BmRQ iat-mode=1"
        ]
      }
    },
    {
      "bridges": {
        "type": "obfs4",
        "source": "bridgedb",
        "bridge_strings": [
          "obfs4 x.x.x.x:x AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA cert=aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa iat-mode=0",
          "obfs4 x.x.x.x:x AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA cert=aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa iat-mode=0"
        ]
      }
    },
    {
      "bridges": {
        "type": "snowflake",
        "source": "builtin",
        "bridge_strings": [
          "snowflake 192.0.2.3:1 2B280B23E1107BB62ABFC40DDCC8824814F80A72"
        ]
      }
    }
  ],
  "country": "de"
}
```
The `settings` list is sorted by the most useful circumvention mechanism first 
for the location. Each `bridges` entry contains the following fields:
* `type` the transport type.
* `source` the source of the bridges to be used. It can be `builtin` for bridges 
  that are publicly included by the client or `bridgedb` for bridges that are 
  not publicly provided just for this client to use.
* `bridge_strings` a list of bridgelines for the client to use.

The `country` is the country code for which those settings are. If no country 
was provided in the request this will be the country discovered from the IP 
address of the requester.

If Tor should work on the location without any circumvention mechanism the 
response will contain an empty list in the `settings` field:
```json
{
  "settings": [],
  "country": "se"
}
```

##### error

The possible error codes in the answer are:
* **400** the request body is not correct:
```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "code": 400,
      "detail": "Not valid request"
    }
  ]
}
```

* **404** the location needs transports but none of the provided ones in the 
  request will work:
```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "code": 404,
      "detail": "No provided transport is available for this country"
    }
  ]
}
```

* **406** moat can't determine the country from the IP address:
```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "code": 406,
      "detail": "Could not find country code for circumvention settings"
    }
  ]
}
```

      "code": 404,
      "detail": "No provided transport is available for this country"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### /circumvention/defaults

Provides a list of default settings to be used if the client can't connect to 
Tor without circumvention mechanism but there are no specific settings for the 
location.

The request, response and errors are the same as for `/circumvention/settings`. 
With the following differences:
* The request body only accepts the `transports` field and no `country` field.
* The error code **406** will not be returned by this endpoint.

#### /circumvention/map

Responds with the current knowledge of the circumvention mechanisms that works 
for each location.

##### response

```json
{
  "cn": {
    "settings": [
      {
        "bridges": {
          "type": "snowflake",
          "source": "builtin"
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  "ru": {
    "settings": [
      {
        "bridges": {

        }
      },
      {
        "bridges": {
          "type": "obfs4",
          "source": "bridgedb"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The json contains the country code and the settings that applies to it. The 
fields are the same as for `/circumvention/settings` but the map doesn't provide 
`bridge_strings`.

#### /circumvention/builtin

Provides the full list of [builtin 
bridges](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/team/-/wikis/Default-Bridges) 
currently in use. Builtin bridges are public bridges often included in the 
client.

### Captcha based endpoints

**The captcha based moat is being deprecated and only supported for backward 
compatibility**

Provides bridges using a captcha as a protection mechanism.

All captcha based requests require the `Content-Type` HTTP header being set 
to `application/vnd.api+json` or the response will contain an error code 
**415**. Requests have to be an *HTTP POST* with an optional json body. 

#### /fetch

Fetch a captcha challenge to get bridges.

##### request

An optional body can be provided in the request with the list of supported 
transports by the client:
```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "type": "client-transports",
      "version": "0.1.0",
      "supported": [
	"obfs4"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

##### response

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "1",
      "type": "moat-challenge",
      "version": "0.1.0",
      "transport": [
        "obfs4",
        "vanilla"
      ],
      "image": "xxxxxx",
      "challenge": "xxxxx"
    }
  ]
}
```

* `image` contains the base64 encoded jpg image of the captcha.
* `challenge` is an unique string associated with the request.
* `transport` list of valid transports in the preferred order.




##### examples

```
$ curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json' https://bridges.torproject.org/moat/fetch
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "1",
      "type": "moat-challenge",
      "version": "0.1.0",
      "transport": [
        "obfs4",
        "vanilla"
      ],
      "image": "xxxx",
      "challenge": "xxxxx"
    }
  ]
}
$ curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json' -d '{"data": [{"type": "client-transports", "version": "0.1.0", "supported": ["obfs4"]}]}' https://bridges.torproject.org/moat/fetch
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "1",
      "type": "moat-challenge",
      "version": "0.1.0",
      "transport": "obfs4",
      "image": "xxxx",
      "challenge": "xxxxx"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### /check

Send the solution of the captcha to get bridges.

##### request 

The request must include a body with the solution of the captcha:
```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "type": "moat-solution",
      "id": "2",
      "version": "0.1.0",
      "transport": "obfs4",
      "challenge": "xxxx",
      "qrcode": "false",
      "solution": "yyyy"
    }
  ]
}
```

* `solution` contains the solution of the captcha.
* `challenge` is the unique string provided in by the /fetch endpoint.
* `transport` the transport type of the bridges we want to get.
* `qrcode` if the response should include a qrcode of the bridgelines.
* `id` must be set to *2*.

##### response

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "3",
      "type": "moat-bridges",
      "version": "0.1.0",
      "bridges": [
        "obfs4 x.x.x.x:x AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA cert=aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa iat-mode=0",
        "obfs4 x.x.x.x:x AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA cert=aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa iat-mode=0"
      ],
      "qrcode": null
    }
  ]
}
```

* `bridges` the list of bridgelines returned.
* `qrcode` if the qrcode has being requested contains the base64 of the jpg.

##### error

If the solution of the challenge is not valid or the challenge has expired it 
will respond with an error code **419**.

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "id": "4",
      "type": "moat-bridges",
      "version": "0.1.0",
      "code": 419,
